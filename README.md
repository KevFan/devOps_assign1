The overall objective of this assignment is to automate using Python 3 the process ofcreating, launching and monitoring a public-facing web server in the Amazon cloud. The web server will run on an EC2 instance and display some static content that is stored in S3.

## Pre-requisites
* [Boto3](http://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/quickstart.html)
* [AWS Cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)

## Feature List
* check_webserver.py
    * Create instance and bucket
    * Upload to bucket
      * Append file url to a running instance to nginx index.html if installed  
    * Copy/Run check_server.py to instance
* check_webserver.py
  * Checks and starts nginx if not running
  * If nginx is not installed, asks user to install
* logs messages to log.txt for record

## Getting started:
```
# Ensure boto3, python3 installed and aws config/credentials configured
git clone <this repo>
cd devOps_assign1
chmod 700 run_newwebserver.py
./run_newwebserver.py
```

Running these command will give the main script read, write and execution permissions and bring up menu for user interaction.

## Improvements
* Testing done manually - should test using unittest
* Do not hard code value for ami id which are region specific and secutiry group id - would cause problems as user's default region could be different
* Incorporate cloudwatch for instance monitoring
* Incorporate ssh specific library such as paramiko for ssh to instance instead of using subprocess library
